## Coca-Cola Journey Interactive 3D Web App

This website was created as part of the submission for the assessment of the 3D Web Application module at the University of Sussex.

**Tech stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, SQLite

**Instructions:** Each product page has 2 models, toggle the can/bottle/cup tabs to interact with each one. Occasionally, the models stop working and seem to freeze on the page. This appears to be an issue with the X3DOM library (see screenshot of error which causes this issue below). If this happens, just reload the page.

## Points of deeper understanding

1. Six models were created and exported using Maxon Cinema 4D.
2. Two renders per model (12 renders total) were generated using the Cinema 4D Standard render engine. Three compositions were created in Adobe Photoshop using the renders.
3. Showdown JS Library used to create About page contents.
4. Regular use of GitHub version control.
